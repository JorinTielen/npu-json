# TODO

- [ ] Build and commit current JSONPath CPU engine code (`throw NotImplemented` on index call is fine)
- [ ] Test & measure multiple kernels in one xclbin, call after each other with results passing without memcopy
- [ ] Research Pison iterator
  - Is it actually parallel?
  - Main loop / iterator state
  - What indices does it rely on?
  - How to adapt up/down/etc actions to jsonpath?
  - Leveled index a good idea after all?
- [ ] Setup JSON processing skeleton
  - Main "event loop" for JSONPath automaton
  - Iterate over file in chunks, calling npu to index each chunk
- [ ] Setup test framework (FileCheck or other i/o test)
  - Build special small "unit"-test executables that run NPU kernels
  - Tests for CPU side JSONPath query parsing
  - End-to-end test with both CPU and NPU indexer
  - Small JSON file and expected index specified in test
    - Test entire large array so dataflow splitting etc. is tested
- [ ] Measure flamegraph of rsonpath
- [ ] (Optional) Set up fancy developer tooling
  - Set up linters
    - `clangd-format` or/and `clangd-tidy` for C++
    - Python: linter and type checking
    - Shellcheck
  - Add license & header to all source files (script)
- [ ] Create thesis project on Overleaf, rough outline of chapters (or just the chapters relevant now)
